        <h3>Work and Educational History</h3>
        <h4>Clinton has worked in the Web Development field for over 2 years. In that time he has had the opportunity to work directly with over 13 different e-commerce clients, producing their app-based shopping 
        applications as well as providing support and site expansion down the road. While this is technically his second career, it has been a labor of love, particularly working in e-commerce. His experience in the 
        military has left him with strong ability to work in a team, take the lead when needed and with a strong enthic to always find a way to "complete the mission".</h4>

                <img src="images/history/zoovy.jpg" />
                <p>Zoovy Inc is an e-commerce platformer that offered comprehensive e-commerce support front to back. From backend hosting and database to front-end customer facing shopping UIs, Zoovy provided a singular 
                place to handle all of the logistics of setting up and maintaining an e-commerce store. Their headline product was the one of a kind appsite package that allowed clients to build both their
                website, mobile site, and ios/android shopping app as a comprehensive single-page application (meaning no difference in user experience across the 3 mediums). It reduced the amount of maintenance required to update
                and upgrade the app as changes and fixes made to the app master were applied to all 3 mediums when upgrades were pushed out. Clinton's role was to work directly with the client and their designer to build the 
                app site utilizing modern techniques like responsive design, W3C validation and the constant pursuit of SEO compliance. In his first year, he successfully built, launched and maintained over 10 different appsites. 
                He also handled post launch upgrades, squashed bugs and maintained a direct line of contact with clients. During his second year at Zoovy, his role migrated more into R&D for the app product instead of new app
                builds. The focus during this time was on testing and improving upon the SEO capabilities of the app in an attempt to nring in line the SEO power of the javascript MCV app framework. His primary contribution
                to this effort was in applying these new experimental builds to existing appsite test groups, testing for bugs, and if possible, applying the bug fixes to both the individual client app and/or the core 
                framework. During this time, he also took on and became responsible for 3 more new client appsites.</p>

                <img src="images/history/xrm.png" />
                <p>xRM.com is a technology company specializing in the creation and distrubution of custom functionality and interfaces for Microsoft CRM. Clinton worked here as a intern software developer during the end
                year of his tenure in college to help build his real world skills of coding and gain exposure to the professional software development process and SDLCs. His primary responsibility while interning was to 
                work on previously performed projects to gain both insight and experience when working with Microsoft CRM, their platform and the coding languages needed to write the various plugins created by the company.
                While the time spent here was relatively short, the skills learned were invaluable and ultimately lead to a job offer at the end of the intern period. The offer however was dependent on relocation to their
                Nevada branch, which unfortunately was not possible for Clinton at the time and he had no choice but to turn down the offer.</p>

                <p class="clearAll" style="color:#ffffff;">This period of time was a roller coaster of opportunities for Clinton. It was during this same period of time that he decided that he wanted to pursue his bachelors degree full-time synchronously with
                maintaining a full-time position so contract work afforded him the best opportunities to fit both school and work into his schedule. The bulk of the contract positions held by him during this time were
                working for known defense contractors like L3 to perform various maintenance and upgrades for the US Navy and the DoD. Because of the nature of contract work, there were lulls in employment during this
                period as well once a contract was completed. During these periods, Clinton kept himself busy by taking on more classes in college to fully take advantage of the time afforded to him by this career
                lifestyle.</p>

                <p>California Analytical Instruments is a manufacturing company specializing in the creation and distribution of industrial level hydrocarbon analyzers. They worked with both large and small scale clients
                across the globe to provide gas detection instrumentation. These analyzers' primary function was to detect hydrocarbon levels in carbon emissions so that industries and companies could better comply with
                state and federal emission regulations. Clinton's role here was the dual role of both the initial calibration of newly created analyzers to fit to the customer's specifications as well as quality control
                inspections of these analyzers during their "burn-in" period to make sure the reading there were giving matched the actual hydrocarbon level it was taking in, before the unit was shipped to its final customer.
                To date, none of the analyzers Clinton calibrated and/or inspected were returned by the customer for faulty readings.</p>

                <img src="images/history/VFA-154.jpg" />
                <p>Clinton's most memorable career decision was the time he Spent with the US Navy. The skills he learned here and the opportunities afforded to him because of his service made all of the above career 
                opportunities possible. He served 5 years, 2 combat deployments, and countless training dets with VFA-154, the Black Knights. The aircraft he worked with primarily was the F/A-18 super hornet. His role 
                encompassed many different requirements ranging from aircraft launching and recovery operations to scheduled and unscheduled electrical/electronic maintenance to literally helping wherever help was needed
                in support of flight operations. In this period of time, he helped contribute to the successful launch and recover of thousands of successful sorties, returned hundreds of aircraft to the ready up status
                via quick troubleshooting and repair of issues that occurred and personally saved at least 15 would-be cancelled flights through quick diagnosis of issues and applying the solution to return the aircraft
                to flightworthy condition in time for launch. The demands of this position alongside the knowledge of what mission completion meant there left Clinton with a high degree of pride in his work and a desire 
                to make that work really mean something.</p>

            <p class="clearAll">From day 1 at DeVry, Clinton knew he wanted to go into software development. Coding had been an accidentally discovered love for him earlier in life when he began toying with mods for popular video games
            to see just what all he could do with these tools. He discovered he had a knack for it and knew he wanted a career change to get back doing work that made an impact and really helped people. He was able to 
            leverage his GI bill benefits to aid in paying down the costs of college and DeVry offered many options both in providing class schedules that worked around full-time employment as well as work placement upon
            graduation so that he could ensure he could get out there and get to pursuing his goals quicker. Even while working full-time, college was always a high (if not the highest) priority for him at the time, resulting
            in his graduating Suma Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.97 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems. Web/mobile has been the direction technology has been pushing strongly for the last decade or so and
            Clinton wanted to be a part of this world changing trend to help contribute to both its successful integration into our lives as well as being a part of its constant evolution.</p>
